# sudoku

A simple project I started for fun and to get extra practice at
translating imperative algorithms to a more declarative functional
style. Right now it is command line only. I may add an interactive 
web front end later.

## Standalone usage
Download the `sudoku.jar` and `board.edn` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Musab-Nazir/SudokuSolver/releases). Update the board in the `board.edn` file if needed and run the program via:

    $ java -jar sudoku.jar

## Dev oriented usage

Assuming you have clojure (1.10.1) installed, you can use the following commands.

Run the project directly:

    $ clojure -M -m musab.sudoku

Run the project's tests (they'll fail until you edit them):

    $ clojure -M:test:runner

Build an uberjar:

    $ clojure -M:uberjar

Run that uberjar:

    $ java -jar sudoku.jar

## Input different board states

By default the board.edn file has a board state added under the input key. Apparently this particular puzzle is the hardest you can find. On my 8 core 16 thread machine it takes ~ 60 seconds, however the runtime depends on the complexty of the puzzle.

Follow the format of the example 2D array/vector for board.edn for any custom boards you enter
